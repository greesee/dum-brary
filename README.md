# Dum-brary
A project I made for my 12th grade CS Project. This was my first actual project (despite the fact that it only took like an hour to code), and I had fun doing it!  
Stuff Required:
- [python-tabulate](https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate)
- MySQL

Note - This was made for a Windows machine, haven't tried running it on Linux yet. Don't bother using this though, it isn't fun to play with, and if you're planning to use this to maintain your library - Don't. You're demented. (but I'll be glad you considered it :) )
